Hoisting : the availability/access of a variable even before the execution of the program.

lexical scope: where a variable is physically present.
scope chain :  chain of all lexical environment with its parent references.   lexical scope of GEC is null.
the whole chain of lexical environment is called the scope chain.

lexical environment : local memory + reference to the lexical env of parent(lexical parent)


a function A which is enclosed inside another function B, then function is the closure of function A.

Temporal Deadzone: is the time since when this let variable was hoisted and till it is intialized some value.
OR from hoisting till it got some value that time is called temporal dead zone.
until the js engine reaches to the to the line where a value is assigned to the let/const variables.


const : for const keyword you must have to initialize it (assign some value) at the time of declaration. 
while assigning different value to const variable it will thorow TypeError : assignemt to const variable.
you cannot left const as (const b | no assignemnt) it will throw SytaxError.


you cannot write like below

let a = 10;
let a = 20;
 it will throw syntax error : identifier a has already been decalred.
 
 Block : block is group of multipl statements  and it can be used where javascript expect single statement.
 one statement means one line of code.
 
 eg.
 if(something === true) getData();
 
 if(something === true) {
 getData();
 hidePopup = true;
 }
 
 
 Block Scope : what all are the variable and functions we can access inside a block is know as the block scope of
				those varibale and funcitons.
				
				block scrope varibales are stored in separate memory space 
				
				
Shadowing: 

var a = 100;

{
var a = 99;
let b = 80;
console.log(a) // 99
}

console.log(a) // 99     | it will change the value of variable a which is present in the globval space.
